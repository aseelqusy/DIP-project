After applying Run-Length Encoding to the image, the raw uncompressed size was approximately 529 KB, while the compressed size decreased to 236.7 KB.
The calculated Compression Ratio is 2.235, which indicates that the compressed image requires less than half the size of the original raw data.

The estimated spatial redundancy was 85.16%, meaning that a large portion of neighboring pixels had identical intensity values. This confirms the presence of inter-pixel redundancy, which is exactly the type of redundancy that RLE (Run-Length Encoding) exploits.

Finally, the computed Redundancy percentage was 55.26%, suggesting that over half of the information in the original image was repetitive and could be removed without losing any actual data (lossless compression).
